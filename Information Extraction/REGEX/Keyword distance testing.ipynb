And that’s when things got weird.”\\nShe claims they let the hitchhiker out near Jackson Dam and he crossed the street to a crowded lot to continue to hitchhike. The TikTok user said she has spoken with the FBI and other law enforcement officials about the alleged encounter, but the FBI didn’t confirm they had spoken to the woman.\\nThe FBI has not confirmed about meeting TikTok user Miranda Baker.\\nTikTok\\nBaker claims she picked up Brian Laundrie, right, at Grand Teton National Park on Aug. 29.\\nTwitter\\nOther law enforcement directed inquiries to the FBI.\\nThat alleged encounter would have taken place just one day before Petito’s mother received a text from the missing Long Island native’s phone on Aug. 30 — but her mom has doubts that the text actually came from her daughter.\\nLaundrie returned to Florida alone on Sept. 1 in the van registered to Petito.\\nBaker said the hitchhiker she believes to be Laundrie first offered “like $200” for the ride, but got in the back of the Jeep free of charge.\\nTikTok user Miranda Baker shows a map of her driving path to Jackson Lake Dam, where she claims to have dropped off Brian Laundrie.\\nTikTok\\nThe hitchhiker allegedly told her he had been hiking for days along the Snake River, and said he had a fiancée who was working their social media pages back at their van, she claims in the video.\\nIn what she called “key information” that she has allegedly shared with authorities, she said the hitchhiker she identified as Laundrie didn’t appear to have a full backpack, saying he had been sleeping on tarp.\\n“You think if you’re going camping for days on end you’d want food and a tent and he had none of that,” Baker said of the alleged encounter.\\nNY Post Illustration\\nThe disappearance of Petito, 22, has sparked social media sleuths as Laundrie has declined to speak with authorities.\\nShare this article:\\n'"
