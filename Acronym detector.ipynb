      "How Fibonaut’s Revolutionary Chart Stabilization Works\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is taken from the Fibonaut whitepaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fibonaut, a BSC-based project, attempts to solve several common issues affecting other cryptocurrency tokens. Decentralized finance has made token creation easier than ever, creating a surge of new tokens each day. Some token creators try new and innovative concepts, though the vast majority of token contracts are carbon copies, changing little more than the name. What’s more, even with those that do offer something unique or different in way of tokenomics, most will fall short of expectations. The reality is that, no matter how ambitious or enticing a project, holders will want to take profits. Everyone invested into a project has the human desire of financial gain in mind at all times. We can consider “the market” to be the collective perception of each and every investor in a project. Because the market all has the same general goal in mind, to make financial gains, the market will more or less behave in a concurrent manner, not unlike a school of fish. Regardless of any small deviations, the group will more or less act predictably similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a token, especially the promising ones, increases in value so does the likelihood that its holders will take profits in order to realize their financial gains. Some of the sellers will sell early, some will sell later, and most will sell around the same time. Then, hopefully, after the price has decreased, more investors will choose to buy in and reset the cycle. However, in the fast-paced world of DeFi, this simple behavior can break a token, by crashing its price beyond repair. Because the market is a group of people, it is prone to emotional reaction and will panic at a declining price, further exacerbating the issue. What’s worse, when new investors join the market, they will (generally) be put off by a crashed token price. There are a few factors which contribute to this unfortunately common outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whales — holders with an unusually high percentage of tokens relative to total supply Complete wallet dumps — holders are able to sell their entire wallets in one sell No transaction limitations — holders are able to sell anytime High circulating supply — tokens are plentiful and given away for free Airdrops — Some holders, who might also be whales, were sent their tokens without having to purchase them High taxes — users encounter high taxes when buying or selling a token, sometimes over 18%\n",
      "\n",
      "The above factors make a token crash all but inevitable. The only thing that could carry a project out of market dumps like that are those that have a good amount of community momentum. This, while nice, is very hard to keep going without major news or mainstream attention. Even then, it will require more and more to keep the price up as the market, still predictable, continues to try to dump at the first sign of profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution to the classic problems of most tokens is Fibonaut’s approach to controlled, limited token sell frequencies. The average investor loses on the majority of their trades. Because the average investor is the market, they will create the same market cycles over and over. In traditional finance a company’s stock price can fluctuate knowing the company has gone nowhere. In DeFi with its inherent volatility, a simple fluctuation can cause a panic, subsequent crash, and spell the end of a token sometimes within hours of launch. The best way forward is to protect holders from themselves and the bad trades of others. Fibonaut does this by implementing the following safeguards:\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Wallet Control — No wallet can hold more 161.8 tokens, which is 1% of the supply, meaning no whales Quantity Limits — No wallet can sell more than 1.618 tokens at a time, meaning no complete wallet dumps causing a sudden drop in price Sell Frequency Limits — No wallet can sell more than once within each allotted interval (explained in the next section), meaning no sudden serial selling attempting to get around the Quantity Limitation Sell Intervals — Wallets can only sell in preset increasing intervals of time, meaning everyone must stagger their sells for longer amounts of time Limited Supply — With a small total supply of 16,180 tokens, and no minting nor self-reflection functions, Fibonaut will eventually encounter major supply shock, further increasing the price No Airdrops — Fibonaut will not airdrop any tokens to anyone, even the team, meaning no one will receive tokens without having to purchase them BUSD Rewards — Holders will receive rewards in BUSD (stablecoin) at 5% of each transaction proportional to their holdings, meaning longterm holders have a way to earn without selling Unique Contract Code — This contract has never been done before; it’s development has been catered specifically to solving the problems of price drop in traditional BSC and ETH-based tokens Sensible Taxes — A simple 10% flat tax applies to all transactions. 5% generates BUSD rewards, 3% automatically is added to token liquidity, and 2% goes to marketing and development of the token\n",
      "\n",
      "The above safeguards will dramatically protect the chart and long-term price action of the token. Huge price fluctuations will not be possible, and steady growth is inevitable. Many of the listed solutions have been done before in DeFi. However, their combination is what is important. Moreover, Fibonaut’s selling intervals are a revolutionary new addition to the traditional Solidity contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why It Works\n",
      "\n",
      "Fibonaut’s sell intervals prevent holders from selling any time they choose to. It effectively forces everyone to abide by the same schedule of long-term holding. However, they increment over time. Holders are only able to sell (up to 1.618 tokens) at each minute number of the Fibonacci sequence from the time of their first buy, with a 1-minute window (margin) for sells occurring in less than one hour (55 minutes), and a 16-minute margin for sells occurring after an hour. If you are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence, this means exponential growth in how long the holder must wait for their next sell. This means that to sell a maximum (1%) wallet of 161.8 tokens, the holder must meet each sell interval (including 1 minute after they bought) for a total of 1,226,132,595,394,188,293,000,174,702,095,995 years.

      "['How Fibonaut’s Revolutionary Chart Stabilization Works\\n\\nThe following is taken from the Fibonaut whitepaper.\\n\\nFibonaut, a BSC-based project, attempts to solve several common issues affecting other cryptocurrency tokens. Decentralized finance has made token creation easier than ever, creating a surge of new tokens each day. Some token creators try new and innovative concepts, though the vast majority of token contracts are carbon copies, changing little more than the name. What’s more, even with those that do offer something unique or different in way of tokenomics, most will fall short of expectations. The reality is that, no matter how ambitious or enticing a project, holders will want to take profits. Everyone invested into a project has the human desire of financial gain in mind at all times. We can consider “the market” to be the collective perception of each and every investor in a project. Because the market all has the same general goal in mind, to make financial gains, the market will more or less behave in a concurrent manner, not unlike a school of fish. Regardless of any small deviations, the group will more or less act predictably similar.\\n\\nAs a token, especially the promising ones, increases in value so does the likelihood that its holders will take profits in order to realize their financial gains. Some of the sellers will sell early, some will sell later, and most will sell around the same time. Then, hopefully, after the price has decreased, more investors will choose to buy in and reset the cycle. However, in the fast-paced world of DeFi, this simple behavior can break a token, by crashing its price beyond repair. Because the market is a group of people, it is prone to emotional reaction and will panic at a declining price, further exacerbating the issue. What’s worse, when new investors join the market, they will (generally) be put off by a crashed token price. There are a few factors which contribute to this unfortunately common outcome:\\n\\nWhales — holders with an unusually high percentage of tokens relative to total supply Complete wallet dumps — holders are able to sell their entire wallets in one sell No transaction limitations — holders are able to sell anytime High circulating supply — tokens are plentiful and given away for free Airdrops — Some holders, who might also be whales, were sent their tokens without having to purchase them High taxes — users encounter high taxes when buying or selling a token, sometimes over 18%\\n\\nThe above factors make a token crash all but inevitable. The only thing that could carry a project out of market dumps like that are those that have a good amount of community momentum. This, while nice, is very hard to keep going without major news or mainstream attention. Even then, it will require more and more to keep the price up as the market, still predictable, continues to try to dump at the first sign of profits.\\n\\nThe Solution\\n\\nThe solution to the classic problems of most tokens is Fibonaut’s approach to controlled, limited token sell frequencies. The average investor loses on the majority of their trades. Because the average investor is the market, they will create the same market cycles over and over. In traditional finance a company’s stock price can fluctuate knowing the company has gone nowhere. In DeFi with its inherent volatility, a simple fluctuation can cause a panic, subsequent crash, and spell the end of a token sometimes within hours of launch. The best way forward is to protect holders from themselves and the bad trades of others. Fibonaut does this by implementing the following safeguards:\\n\\nMax Wallet Control — No wallet can hold more 161.8 tokens, which is 1% of the supply, meaning no whales Quantity Limits — No wallet can sell more than 1.618 tokens at a time, meaning no complete wallet dumps causing a sudden drop in price Sell Frequency Limits — No wallet can sell more than once within each allotted interval (explained in the next section), meaning no sudden serial selling attempting to get around the Quantity Limitation Sell Intervals — Wallets can only sell in preset increasing intervals of time, meaning everyone must stagger their sells for longer amounts of time Limited Supply — With a small total supply of 16,180 tokens, and no minting nor self-reflection functions, Fibonaut will eventually encounter major supply shock, further increasing the price No Airdrops — Fibonaut will not airdrop any tokens to anyone, even the team, meaning no one will receive tokens without having to purchase them BUSD Rewards — Holders will receive rewards in BUSD (stablecoin) at 5% of each transaction proportional to their holdings, meaning longterm holders have a way to earn without selling Unique Contract Code — This contract has never been done before; it’s development has been catered specifically to solving the problems of price drop in traditional BSC and ETH-based tokens Sensible Taxes — A simple 10% flat tax applies to all transactions. 5% generates BUSD rewards, 3% automatically is added to token liquidity, and 2% goes to marketing and development of the token\\n\\nThe above safeguards will dramatically protect the chart and long-term price action of the token. Huge price fluctuations will not be possible, and steady growth is inevitable. Many of the listed solutions have been done before in DeFi. However, their combination is what is important. Moreover, Fibonaut’s selling intervals are a revolutionary new addition to the traditional Solidity contract.\\n\\nWhy It Works\\n\\nFibonaut’s sell intervals prevent holders from selling any time they choose to. It effectively forces everyone to abide by the same schedule of long-term holding. However, they increment over time. Holders are only able to sell (up to 1.618 tokens) at each minute number of the Fibonacci sequence from the time of their first buy, with a 1-minute window (margin) for sells occurring in less than one hour (55 minutes), and a 16-minute margin for sells occurring after an hour. If you are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence, this means exponential growth in how long the holder must wait for their next sell. This means that to sell a maximum (1%) wallet of 161.8 tokens, the holder must meet each sell interval (including 1 minute after they bought) for a total of 1,226,132,595,394,188,293,000,174,702,095,995 years. Holders are not able to cheat the system, either. Buying again will not reset the _firstBuy timestamp, so their first buy will set the timetable of allowed sell points and margins for their wallet’s lifetime. Holders are not able to transfer tokens from wallet to wallet to evade this system.\\n\\nHow It Works\\n\\nFibonacci Sequence — Each Number is a Sell Interval\\n\\n_fibArray = 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 …\\n\\nIf a user, Bob, decides to buy any', 'amount', 'of', 'Fibonaut']\n",

      "['On December 17, BitWell initial listed the popular GameFi project GoldMiner (GM), opened GM/USDT spot trading, launched deposit and trading tournament.\\n\\nThe same day, GoldMiner CTO Victor was a guest of BitWell community, bringing users a project sharing.\\n\\nThe following is a complete review of the content of this sharing.\\n\\nHost: Catherine, VP of BitWell Overseas Market\\n\\nCatherine：First, please briefly introduce your career, self-introduction and Gold Miner, what kind of project it is？\\n\\nVictor：I am one of the principals of Gold Miner, working for a well-known game company in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nGoldMiner aims to build an open and decentralized meta-universe and eliminate the centralized platform of traditional game distribution.\\n\\nTherefore, the ecosystem is very important to protect the interests of all participants and maintain the balance of the economic system’s ecosystem.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this goal, the ecosystem design has been carefully considered from three aspects:\\n\\n1. Ensure that the value of gold tokens continues to increase.\\n\\n2. Build a complete closed loop of economic ecology.\\n\\n3. Establish a highly decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to allow both groups and individuals to win.\\n\\nGoldMiner is a high user, designed to let you gain wealth while enjoying puzzle games.\\n\\nGoldMiner is a classic third-person shooter NFT game, and its condition is that anyone can start playing without paying expensive upfront payments.\\n\\nIn addition, “Gold Miner” uses the Play-to-Earn model to provide players with tokens and equipment by participating in dynamic games and PvP tournaments.\\n\\nBy seamlessly combining DeFi and P2E models in this way, GoldMiner provides players with the opportunity to play games and get rewards at the same time.\\n\\nIn order to create a relaxing environment for players who are not familiar with the cryptocurrency market and NFT, we have added a mechanism called crypto battle to the gameplay to encourage these players to conduct their own research and understand the market.\\n\\nCatherine：How many members do you have in your team since the beginning of its development? Did you have any differences while implementing some plans, and how to resolve them?\\n\\nVictor：Due to the needs of project development, the team initially only had about 20 people, but it has now grown to hundreds.\\n\\nRegarding the issue of anti-robots, we have two internal solutions. After repeated discussions among our internal members and listening to a large number of feedback from real users, we finally decided to sanction these robots.\\n\\nCatherine：Next, please introduce the economic model in the game. How do users make money through this game?\\n\\nVictor：1. Players can start the game and purchase NFT heroes through tutorials to obtain various rare equipment.\\n\\n2. Play the game in PvE or PvP mode.\\n\\n3. Players can sell these items on the market and get $GM tokens.\\n\\n4. You can mint powerful NFTs and use GM tokens to auction them or directly trade with other players.\\n\\n5. Players can participate in regular tournaments and activities held by the Gold Medal Game Studio to win prizes and rewards.\\n\\n6. You can bet with other players in PvP mode to get more tokens.\\n\\nCatherine：Can you tell us in detail about the token repurchase and destruction?\\n\\nVictor：We carried out repurchase burns on December 15th, December 8th and November 17th. The cumulative number of burned tokens exceeded 2 billion. This is an amazing number. The detailed information can be found on our Twitter. See, everything is fair and transparent.\\n\\nCatherine：What is your team’s short-term planning for this project?\\n\\nVictor：We will focus on two aspects in the short term. One is marketing. We will find more influential people and exchanges in the cryptocurrency field for deeper cooperation. On the other hand, the focus is on the project itself. The official server of the game is not long after it is online, and there are many areas that need to be optimized.

      "\n",
      "This post is based on my presentation at The Mobile Innovation Summit, New York City, March 10, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "With upwards of 2 Million apps on the iOS App Store and 2.4 Million on Google Play success at engaging and retaining users has never been more important than it is today. In fact, according to eMarketer, in 2016 retention rates continue to slip for all app categories. If you’re growing a business that depends upon digital product usage to drive monetization then these statistics should set off alarm bells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’ve managed to be heard above the din of these millions of competing voices, how do you connect with your newly won users, provide them real value and keep them from falling off the edge of the retention cliff?\n",
      "\n",
      "At AccuWeather, where I lead the User Experience and Product Design team for all digital platforms globally, we take these questions very seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently had an epiphany about this important challenge that led to the topic of this piece: The Very Human Art of Knowing What to Say.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCENE ONE\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you are standing in the middle of Times Square in New York City on a beautiful early summer night. People throng around you, and your visual sense is completely filled by pulsing lights, colors and signs both static and alive with movement. Words, pictures, videos, brands, faces, products. Hundreds of messages vie for your attention. To a small number of these messages you grant a few precious seconds of focus, but for most you simply relax your eyes and let them blend in to the fuzzy tapestry of the electric scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Times Square makes for a compelling illustration of the challenges one faces in the realm of app development, especially in our age of content profusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the weather space, advances in forecasting science and technology by the AccuWeather team have made new forecast and weather data types available to us for inclusion in our digital products. Forecasts are more granular in terms of time and location (MinuteCast). They go farther out chronologically (90-Day Forecast). They encompass new parameters and data types (Pollen Count and Air Quality). They express new and more advanced meteorological concepts (Forecast Confidence.)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this innovation represents valuable new content that we can offer to our users.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if we do not prioritize that profusion of content what we end up with is Times Square. Many messages jostle for attention but none of them truly succeeds in connecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking through Times Square at night is a thrilling, awe-inspiring, overwhelming and fun experience — but it cannot be the model for a daily mobile application experience. In particular for a weather app, where the user will often check multiple times per day and most sessions last less than a minute, we can ill-afford to lapse in to a Times Square-like user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to make tough prioritization decisions and communicate messages with appropriate context, users will burn out, lose trust in us and eventually abandon our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCENE TWO\n",
      "\n",
      "Now contrast Times Square to what you might experience along the trail to the Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal. As you climb you see ahead of you a fork in the trail and next to one path stands a bold yellow sign with large black letters and a big red arrow. WAY TO MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP →\n",
      "\n",
      "A singular message with perfect clarity and context with no distractions and surrounded by a scene of absolute wonder and beauty. When you are on your way to the Mount Everest basecamp and you see this sign, you know which way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain weather situations that allow for this kind of “bold sign on the trail” clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the major blizzard of January 2016 that crushed the eastern US delivering feet of snow to major metros like New York City, literally shutting down the city and causing unfortunate loss of life. My mother, a longtime city resident, didn’t leave her apartment for 2 days during the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have a major weather event such as this impacting a large number of people, it is not hard to know what to say. The story needs to be told. At AccuWeather we place an incredible focus on helping people to prepare for and be safe during events such as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this not the everyday reality in which we exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVERYDAY REALITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Most days are far more complex and nuanced than the examples above, and people’s personal priorities, goals, values and interests play a much more important role in prioritizing messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the AccuWeather Mission:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We Personalize the Weather so People Can Improve Their Lives”\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT… How do you personalize the weather? How do you make it meaningful?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because in the end it’s about people. And it’s about creating digital experiences that are human.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we bring our humanity to digital and how do we build a relationship with our users that helps us know what to say?\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we should start by trying to answer to this deceptively simple question:\n",
      "\n",
      "What matters to your users?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will show that the key to answering this question and acting on that knowledge lies in the human act of friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendship is the ultimate communication enabler. That’s why we are talking about the Very Human Art of Knowing What to Say.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about friendship makes it such an incredible enabler of communication?\n",
      "\n",
      "First I will share the story of my recent epiphany that illustrates how friendship enables communication. Then I will illuminate the dimensions of friendship that make it a powerful communication enabler. Finally we’ll begin to explore how to apply these ideas to product development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendship may sound like a bit of a squishy topic, so I will provide concrete examples of what we at AccuWeather do to humanize our products and bring the power of friendship to bear on the communication of the weather. But I’m also going to take you beyond what we do and share some ideas about what further actions and areas of exploration might be available to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE EPIPHANY\n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s start with the original source of my epiphany. I want to tell you a story about my favorite source for personalized weather forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I reveal this important resource I have to warn you that you will most likely not be able to obtain direct access. Distribution is extremely limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact there is only one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meet Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry on the AccuWeather Operations Floor\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry is a Senior Meteorologist at AccuWeather, a member of one of the earth’s greatest meteorology teams, the team the powers all of AccuWeather’s products relied upon by billions of people around the world every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry has been at AccuWeather for 30 years. In the course of my 4 years with the company we have become good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry and I talk pretty much every day. Henry’s a mountain and road biking buddy of mine. As outdoor adventure sports enthusiasts the weather is naturally a big topic for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing I love about Henry (as a weather source, that is) is that he knows exactly what to tell me — what I care about, what weather impacts matter to me — and he gives me insights in to things that would take great effort to figure out on my own. He’s also a great storyteller.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, some days I will see Henry and he’ll say something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry: Better get your ride in over lunch EZ, looks like the rain is coming in around 4pm today.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long did that take, 15 seconds? I didn’t even have to ask Henry about it. He just told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s another example. I seek Henry out on Monday:\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Henry, I’m heading to Menlo Park tomorrow, flying out of State College at 11am to Detroit and then SFO. Am I good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry: Yeah, you’ll be ok, the ice isn’t coming in until the early afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that was a complex travel planning example, and how long did that take? 30 seconds?\n",
      "\n",
      "My interactions with Henry around the weather are an incredibly efficient, effective and frictionless experience for me. And the reason why Henry is able to deliver such targeted, relevant and timely information to me is because he knows me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we are friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have to confess as amazing as Henry is, he does have a few shortcomings. Henry’s memory, processing power and uptime are fairly limited compared to what’s available these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, for a human being he’s pretty stellar, but compared to cutting edge mobile and cloud computing technology and infrastructure he’s pretty limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I actually have another favorite weather source, and that is the AccuWeather app for iOS.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this app for a host of reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "One — My team created this app, and I am truly proud of their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two — This app is beautiful, and I enjoy looking at it\n",
      "\n",
      "Three — This app provides all of the relevant current condition and forecast information I could possibly want for more than 3 million locations around the world, going out 15 days and down to the minute with severe weather alerts, visualizations, graphs, videos, maps and user reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four — It fits in my pocket and I can keep it with me day and night. It’s always available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the person responsible for the experience users have with AccuWeather’s digital products, I am always thinking, how can this app be more like Henry?\n",
      "\n",
      "More specifically, how might we bring some of the magic of the Henry interactions — efficient, effective, frictionless, personal, great storytelling — to our digital products? Let’s start by looking at what kinds of interactions Henry and I have and see how they might map to digital analogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "HENRY MOMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a list of what I call my “Henry Moments”. These are the key interactions and conversation types that Henry and I have about the weather.\n",

      "\n",
      "• Unexpected Drop-In: Henry shares something important that he wants me to know.\n",

      "['The Very Human Art of Knowing What to Say — Engaging and Retaining Mobile Users in an Age of Content Profusion\\n\\nThis post is based on my presentation at The Mobile Innovation Summit, New York City, March 10, 2016\\n\\nWith upwards of 2 Million apps on the iOS App Store and 2.4 Million on Google Play success at engaging and retaining users has never been more important than it is today. In fact, according to eMarketer, in 2016 retention rates continue to slip for all app categories. If you’re growing a business that depends upon digital product usage to drive monetization then these statistics should set off alarm bells.\\n\\nOnce you’ve managed to be heard above the din of these millions of competing voices, how do you connect with your newly won users, provide them real value and keep them from falling off the edge of the retention cliff?\\n\\nAt AccuWeather, where I lead the User Experience and Product Design team for all digital platforms globally, we take these questions very seriously.\\n\\nI recently had an epiphany about this important challenge that led to the topic of this piece: The Very Human Art of Knowing What to Say.\\n\\nSCENE ONE\\n\\nImagine you are standing in the middle of Times Square in New York City on a beautiful early summer night. People throng around you, and your visual sense is completely filled by pulsing lights, colors and signs both static and alive with movement. Words, pictures, videos, brands, faces, products. Hundreds of messages vie for your attention. To a small number of these messages you grant a few precious seconds of focus, but for most you simply relax your eyes and let them blend in to the fuzzy tapestry of the electric scene.\\n\\nTimes Square makes for a compelling illustration of the challenges one faces in the realm of app development, especially in our age of content profusion.\\n\\nIn the weather space, advances in forecasting science and technology by the AccuWeather team have made new forecast and weather data types available to us for inclusion in our digital products. Forecasts are more granular in terms of time and location (MinuteCast). They go farther out chronologically (90-Day Forecast). They encompass new parameters and data types (Pollen Count and Air Quality). They express new and more advanced meteorological concepts (Forecast Confidence.)\\n\\nAll of this innovation represents valuable new content that we can offer to our users.\\n\\nHowever, if we do not prioritize that profusion of content what we end up with is Times Square. Many messages jostle for attention but none of them truly succeeds in connecting.\\n\\nWalking through Times Square at night is a thrilling, awe-inspiring, overwhelming and fun experience — but it cannot be the model for a daily mobile application experience. In particular for a weather app, where the user will often check multiple times per day and most sessions last less than a minute, we can ill-afford to lapse in to a Times Square-like user experience.\\n\\nIf we fail to make tough prioritization decisions and communicate messages with appropriate context, users will burn out, lose trust in us and eventually abandon our products.\\n\\nSCENE TWO\\n\\nNow contrast Times Square to what you might experience along the trail to the Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal. As you climb you see ahead of you a fork in the trail and next to one path stands a bold yellow sign with large black letters and a big red arrow. WAY TO MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP →\\n\\nA singular message with perfect clarity and context with no distractions and surrounded by a scene of absolute wonder and beauty. When you are on your way to the Mount Everest basecamp and you see this sign, you know which way to go.\\n\\nThere are certain weather situations that allow for this kind of “bold sign on the trail” clarity.\\n\\nTake the major blizzard of January 2016 that crushed the eastern US delivering feet of snow to major metros like New York City, literally shutting down the city and causing unfortunate loss of life. My mother, a longtime city resident, didn’t leave her apartment for 2 days during the storm.\\n\\nWhen you have a major weather event such as this impacting a large number of people, it is not hard to know what to say. The story needs to be told. At AccuWeather we place an incredible focus on helping people to prepare for and be safe during events such as this.\\n\\nBut this not the everyday reality in which we exist.\\n\\nEVERYDAY REALITY\\n\\nMost days are far more complex and nuanced than the examples above, and people’s personal priorities, goals, values and interests play a much more important role in prioritizing messages.\\n\\nThus the AccuWeather Mission:\\n\\n“We Personalize the Weather so People Can Improve Their Lives”\\n\\nBUT… How do you personalize the weather? How do you make it meaningful?\\n\\nBecause in the end it’s about people. And it’s about creating digital experiences that are human.\\n\\nHow do we bring our humanity to digital and how do we build a relationship with our users that helps us know what to say?\\n\\nI believe we should start by trying to answer to this deceptively simple question:\\n\\nWhat matters to your users?\\n\\nI will show that the key to answering this question and acting on that knowledge lies in the human act of friendship.\\n\\nFriendship is the ultimate communication enabler. That’s why we are talking about the Very Human Art of Knowing What to Say.\\n\\nBut what about friendship makes it such an incredible enabler of communication?\\n\\nFirst I will share the story of my recent epiphany that illustrates how friendship enables communication. Then I will illuminate the dimensions of friendship that make it a powerful communication enabler. Finally we’ll begin to explore how to apply these ideas to product development.\\n\\nFriendship may sound like a bit of a squishy topic, so I will provide concrete examples of what we at AccuWeather do to humanize our products and bring the power of friendship to bear on the communication of the weather. But I’m also going to take you beyond what we do and share some ideas about what further actions and areas of exploration might be available to us.\\n\\nTHE EPIPHANY\\n\\nSo let’s start with the original source of my epiphany. I want to tell you a story about my favorite source for personalized weather forecasts.\\n\\nBefore I reveal this important resource I have to warn you that you will most likely not be able to obtain direct access. Distribution is extremely limited.\\n\\nIn fact there is only one.\\n\\nMeet Henry.\\n\\nHenry on the AccuWeather Operations Floor\\n\\nHenry is a Senior Meteorologist at AccuWeather, a member of one of the earth’s greatest meteorology teams, the team the powers all of AccuWeather’s products relied upon by billions of people around the world every day.\\n\\nHenry has been at AccuWeather for 30 years. In the course of my 4 years with the company we have become good friends.\\n\\nHenry and I talk pretty much every day. Henry’s a mountain and road biking buddy of mine. As outdoor adventure sports enthusiasts the weather is naturally a big topic for us.\\n\\nThe thing I love about Henry (as a weather source, that is) is that he knows exactly what to tell me — what I care about, what weather impacts matter to me — and he gives me insights in to things that would take great effort to figure out on my own. He’s also a great storyteller.\\n\\nFor example, some days I will see Henry and he’ll say something like this:\\n\\nHenry: Better get your ride in over lunch EZ, looks like the rain is coming in around 4pm today.\\n\\nHow long did that take, 15 seconds? I didn’t even have to ask Henry about it. He just told me.\\n\\nHere’s another example. I seek Henry out on Monday:\\n\\nMe: Henry, I’m heading to Menlo Park tomorrow, flying out of State College at 11am to Detroit and then SFO. Am I good?\\n\\nHenry: Yeah, you’ll be ok, the ice isn’t coming in until the early afternoon.\\n\\nNow that was a complex travel planning example, and how long did that take? 30 seconds?\\n\\nMy interactions with Henry around the weather are an incredibly efficient, effective and frictionless experience for me. And the reason why Henry is able to deliver such targeted, relevant and timely information to me is because he knows me.\\n\\nBecause we are friends.\\n\\nBut I have to confess as amazing as Henry is, he does have a few shortcomings. Henry’s memory, processing power and uptime are fairly limited compared to what’s available these days.\\n\\nTo be fair, for a human being he’s pretty stellar, but compared to cutting edge mobile and cloud computing technology and infrastructure he’s pretty limited.\\n\\nSo, I actually have another favorite weather source, and that is the AccuWeather app for iOS.\\n\\nI love this app for a host of reasons.\\n\\nOne — My team created this app, and I am truly proud of their work.\\n\\nTwo — This app is beautiful, and I enjoy looking at it\\n\\nThree — This app provides all of the relevant current condition and forecast information I could possibly want for more than 3 million locations around the world, going out 15 days and down to the minute with severe weather alerts, visualizations, graphs, videos, maps and user reports.\\n\\nFour — It fits in my pocket and I can keep it with me day and night. It’s always available.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the person responsible for the experience users have with AccuWeather’s digital products, I am always thinking, how can this app be more like Henry?\\n\\nMore specifically, how might we bring some of the magic of the Henry interactions — efficient, effective, frictionless, personal, great storytelling — to our digital products? Let’s start by looking at what kinds of interactions Henry and I have and see how they might map to digital analogs.\\n\\nHENRY MOMENTS\\n\\nHere is a list of what I call my “Henry Moments”. These are the key interactions and conversation types that Henry and I have about the weather.\\n\\n• Daily Morning Conversation\\n\\n• Unexpected Drop-In: Henry shares something important that he wants me to know.\\n\\n• Event Tracking: When Henry knows about an event that I have coming up and provides me updates on the weather for that day in the days and weeks leading up to the event.\\n\\n• Travel Planning\\n\\n• Weekend Weather Talk\\n\\n• Activity Planning: For example, Me: Heading out for a hike with my family tomorrow. Henry: Great. Should be beautiful.)\\n\\n• Two Week Outlook: This might sound like, “It’ll be warmer this week but the cold is coming back next Tuesday and will stick around for another week.”\\n\\n• Seasonal Outlook: In 2015 with the El Nino pattern Henry was talking about the warm winter before we even got to Labor Day.\\n\\n• Banging on Doors: This is one of my personal favorites. You see Henry cares a great deal about people and he wants to make sure that important stories get told. When there’s a major weather event with dangerous impacts likely Henry stalks around the AccuWeather headquarters saying things like “Do we have videos, do we have news stories, is it in the apps and on the sites?” He’s banging on doors to make sure the story gets told.\\n\\nI’d like to bring to life one of my Henry Moments — Event Tracking — with a story that will highlight the value of Henry’s communications to me.\\n\\nEvery January, Henry and I and a bunch of friends and fellow bike peeps ride an insane event called Frozen Fat.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They can turn into many types of cells, which I will write about below, as our body needs it. Stem cells are additionally able to provide a supplement for cells that need healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five types of stem cells :\n",
      "\n",
      "Embryonic stem cells, that come after the sperm fertilizes an egg. About 3 to 5 days after the pregnancy is initiated, a blastocyst/ball of cells forms from the embryo. After this, in about 4 to 5 days, the stem cells arise and this is how they’re formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adult or tissue-specific stem cells, which are found in small numbers in most of our bodies’ tissues. These stem cells are found in many places such as your bone marrow, your bloodstream, your brain, the muscles in your skeleton, your liver, and your skin!\n",
      "\n",
      "Induced pluripotent stem cells, which are regular cells that scientists have altered to act like embryonic stem cells. Scientists extract cells from tissue-specific cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells, cells found in the stroma/connective tissue around the body’s tissues. They are being used to create new bone tissues, and have hope for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amniotic fluid + Cord blood stem cells. Cord blood stem cells are found in the umbilical cord after birth, and are able to be frozen to be used in the future. These cells can treat people with blood problems. There are also some cells found in amniotic fluid, which is the liquid around the developing baby in a mother’s womb, but there is not enough research done on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to what you might believe, these cells do have a very large medical benefit. There have been several studies that involve stem cells being used to treat certain diseases and sicknesses.\n",

      "Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "In a study with mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brain disappeared, they began to become more prone to diseases. They decided to take stem cells from baby mice brains and inject them into the brains (hypothalamus) of middle-aged/old-aged mice.\n",

      "A hypothalamus is a polyp that helps regulate a ton of the body’s functions. The new, nice stem cells reinvigorated older ones by secreting Micro RNAs that stabilized their metabolism.\n",

      "This is because the supply of stem cells declines as we age. Adding a new supply of stem cells frequently to regions of the body like the hypothalamus could slow down, or reverse the aging process.
